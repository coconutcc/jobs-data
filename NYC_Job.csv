DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees.  DEP's water supply system is comprised of 19 reservoirs and 3 controlled lakes throughout the systemâs 2,000 square mile watershed that extends 125 miles north and west of the City.  The DEP is required under a 2005 Order on Consent to reduce combined sewer overflows (CSOs) from its sewer  system to improve the water quality of its surrounding waters, such as Flushing Bay, Jamaica Bay, and tributaries to  the East River, Long Island Sound, and Outer Harbor. Under the 2005 Consent Order, the DEP has  completed Waterbody/Watershed Facility Plans, which are the initial phase of CSO planning, and are required to construct various grey infrastructure projects, and develop Long-Term Control Plans. In 2011, the New York State  Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) and DEP identified numerous modifications to the CSO Consent Order, including integration of green infrastructure and substitution of more cost-effective grey infrastructure, and  agreed to fixed dates for submittal of the Long-Term Control Plans.  In March 2012, the New York State DEC and DEP signed a groundbreaking agreement to reduce CSOs using a hybrid green and gray infrastructure approach. DEP has been working with key public agency partners (such as NYC Department of Parks and Recreation, NYC Department of Education, NYC Housing Authority etc.)  to implement green infrastructure retrofits on publicly owned land.

DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees.  DEP's water supply system is comprised of 19 reservoirs and 3 controlled lakes throughout the systemâs 2,000 square mile watershed that extends 125 miles north and west of the City.

DEP's water supply system is comprised of 19 reservoirs and 3 controlled lakes throughout the systemâs 2,000 square mile watershed that extends 125 miles north and west of the City.  The Bureau of Engineering Design & Construction (BEDC) currently has $4.2B of active construction contracts, $9.4B of design contracts, and another $10.5B of future projects projected in the 10-year commitment plan under the responsibility and management of the bureau. The projects BEDC implement allow DEP as a whole to continue to operate and maintain an exemplary water supply system.  The Agencyâs Vision is to be the safest, most efficient, cost effective, resilient, and transparent water utility in the nation. In order to carry out the mission of providing high quality, reliable water supply to New York City and some upstate communities, the Department operates a network of watershed wastewater treatment plants, dams, bridges, shafts, reservoirs, tunnels, pumping stations, ultraviolet disinfection systems, filtration systems, and associated facilities throughout New York City and its watershed.

DEP's water supply system is comprised of 19 reservoirs and 3 controlled lakes throughout the systemâs 2,000 square mile watershed that extends 125 miles north and west of the City.  The Bureau of Engineering Design & Construction (BEDC) currently has $4.2B of active construction contracts, $9.4B of design contracts, and another $10.5B of future projects projected in the 10-year commitment plan under the responsibility and management of the bureau. The projects BEDC implement allow DEP as a whole to continue to operate and maintain an exemplary water supply system.  The Agencyâs Vision is to be the safest, most efficient, cost effective, resilient, and transparent water utility in the nation.

DEP is the largest combined municipal water and wastewater utility in the country, with nearly 6,000 employees.  DEP's water supply system is comprised of 19 reservoirs and 3 controlled lakes throughout the systemâs 2,000 square mile watershed that extends 125 miles north and west of the City.  The Bureau of Engineering Design & Construction (BEDC) currently has $4.2B of active construction contracts, $9.4B of design contracts, and another $10.5B of future projects projected in the 10-year commitment plan under the responsibility and management of the bureau. The projects BEDC implement allow DEP as a whole to continue to operate and maintain an exemplary water supply system.  The Agencyâs Vision is to be the safest, most efficient, cost effective, resilient, and transparent water utility in the nation. In order to carry out the mission of providing high quality, reliable water supply to New York City and some upstate communities, the Department operates a network of watershed wastewater treatment plants, dams, bridges, shafts, reservoirs, tunnels, pumping stations, ultraviolet disinfection systems, filtration systems, and associated facilities throughout New York City and its watershed. A substantial multibillion-dollar capital program is required to provide for new infrastructure as well as the reconstruction of existing assets to ensure the integrity, continuity, and high quality of the water supply. The Water System Capital Program (WSCP) provides for the planning, design, construction management, and construction required to support our operating bureaus.   BEDCâs Water System Capital Program (WSCP) staff oversees the design and construction of all capital projects managed on behalf of the Bureau of Water Supply (BWS) and Bureau of Water and Sewer Operations (BWSO). Some of the capital projects delivered include water tunnels, dam reconstruction, road and bridge reconstruction, valve chamber reconstruction, water treatment system installations, building construction, hydropower installations and wetland and natural resource projects. WSCP consists of a group of project managers and engineers who manage capital projects consistent with BEDCâs project delivery and construction management procedures, with an emphasis on environmental health and safety, scope, schedule, budget, and client service.  BEDC seeks to hire an Administrative Construction Project Manager MIII to be the Deputy Portfolio Manager (PM) overseeing the administration and operation of a significant subset of projects within a Water System Capital Program directorate.  The Deputy PM will support the PM managing a portfolio of upstate Water System Capital Program projects including: Rondout-West Branch Bypass Tunnel Construction, Hudson River Drainage Chamber Rehabilitation, Rehabilitation of Catskill Aqueduct Chambers and Shaft 4 Valve Replacement. Manages several In-CM projects East and West of Hudson.  A portfolio typically consists of a dozen large-scale capital projects in various stages of planning, design and construction with an aggregate value of $1 Billion or more.   The Deputy PM will manage assigned projects, while also overseeing AM staff managing projects within the same program or project groups.  While assigned projects will change as existing projects are closed out and new projects are initiated, typical assigned projects include time-sensitive work on various consent order, mayoral priority or other mandated projects.   The Deputy PM will direct the oversight of the planning, design and construction of major capital construction projects for a program that will allow the DEP to meet its water system requirements into the future. The selected candidate will be responsible for the achievement of project goals and milestones, ensuring that all prepared schedules, reports, and work products conform to the scope of work. In addition, the Deputy PM will support the preparation, negotiation, and processing of appropriate modifications to Consultant Contract scope, cost, and schedule for successful project completion.
